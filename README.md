This application is for the commercial building officials. It basically allows them to keep a record of the incoming/outgoing vehicles in their parking lot.

The regular customers coming to the building have a qrcode associated with them. If a customer's vehicle has a qrcode it means that the vehicle details are already stored in the database.

So whenever the customer comes, using this application,the building official would scan the qrcode on the customer's vehicle. This opens an active session for the customer's vehicle.
When the customer leaves, the qr code is scanned again and the active session of the customer vehicle will become completed.
